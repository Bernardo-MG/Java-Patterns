/**
 * Provides interfaces and basic implementations for outputters.
 * <p>
 * An outputter sends a data structure through an output operation.
 * <p>
 * This solves the need of writing a data structure to a file, for example.
 * <p>
 * Basic XML outputters for XML files are included in the {@code xml} package.
 * These are based on JDOM2 and meant to ease the use of this library.
