/**
 * Interface for the parser pattern.
 * <p>
 * This pattern allows to transform a structure received as input to another
 * one, both containing the same or similar data. If no data is lost during this
 * process, then it is said to be a lossless parsing, otherwise it is a lossfull
 * one, but that is an implementation detail, not handled by the interface.
 * <p>
 * Usually this interface is used as part of a file reading process, where a
 * {@code Parser} which receives a {@code Reader} for the file and returns a
 * model object. But it can be adapted to any job where it is required to
 * transform data.
 * <p>
 * While this is perfectly good use, it is preferable to use parsers for the
 * smallest possible job and then chain their results. In the previous example
 * reading the file and parsing its contents are two different sections on the
 * parsing process.
 * <p>
 * So it is possible to create a parser which receives the {@code Reader} and
 * returns a {@code Map} with the contents, and then a second which receives
 * this {@code Map} and returns a model object. The value returned from the
 * first is given to the second, which then creates the final one.
 * <p>
 * This way the parsers become easier to maintain, and if possible also
 * reusable.
