 * Interface for the repository pattern. Offers a way to apply CRUD operations

 * This serves as a way to handle persistent data, without needing to know where
 * that data persists.
 * <p>
 * Most of the methods on this interface are very simple, but the one used for
 * reading, the {@link #getCollection getCollection(Filter)} method, has a bit
 * of additional complexity due it's use of {@code Predicate}.
 * <p>
 * And still that one is too very straightforward, as that method will just
 * return all the entities which validate the received {@code Filter}.
