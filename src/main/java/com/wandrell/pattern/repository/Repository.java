/**
 * Interface for the repository pattern. Offers a way to apply CRUD operations
 * into a collection of instances taken from a hidden source.
 * <p>
 * This serves as a way to handle persistent data, without needing to know where
 * that data persists.
 * <p>
 * Most of the methods on this interface are very simple, but the one used for
 * reading, the {@link #getCollection(Object) getCollection} method, has a bit
 * of additional complexity due it's requirement of a filter.
 * <p>
 * This method receives a class containing the required information to build a
 * subset of entities, created from those in the repository. How this works, and
 * which structure will be used as a filter, will depend on the implementation.
