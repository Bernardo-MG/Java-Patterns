 * Interface for implementing the repository pattern.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface contain a set of entities. The source of
 * this data does not matter, as one of the uses of this interface is hiding it.
 * <p>
 * These entities can be easily modified or queried with the interface's
 * methods, which allow CRUD operations.
 * <p>
 * Most of the methods related to these operations are very simple, but the one
 * used for reading, the {@link #getCollection} method, has a bit of additional
 * complexity due to the use of {@code Predicate}.
 * <p>
 * Still, it is very straightforward. The method will return all the entities
 * which validate the received {@code Predicate}.
