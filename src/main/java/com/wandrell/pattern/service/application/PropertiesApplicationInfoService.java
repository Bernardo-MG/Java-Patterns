/**
 * Properties based implementation of {@link ApplicationInfoService}. All the
 * info to be returned by this class is stored on a properties file.
 * <p>
 * The data of the properties file is received as a {@code Properties} object by
 * the constructor, and is expected to not change during the execution of the
 * application.
 * <p>
 * This data will be read from specific keys, which should be stored, along a
 * valid value, on the {@code Properties}.
 * <p>
 * These keys and their expected values are as follow:
 * <table summary="Application info key-value pairs" border=1>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Key</th>
 * <th>Value</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>url.download</td>
 * <td>Application's download URL</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>author.name</td>
 * <td>Author's name</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>author.email</td>
 * <td>Author's email</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>application.title</td>
 * <td>Application's title</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>application.version</td>
 * <td>Application's version</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * All these pairs are required to be on the received {@code Properties}
 * instance for the service to work correctly.
 * <p>
 * To ease the use of this class, a template properties file can be found at the
 * path {@code src/files/application-info.properties} on this library.
 * <p>
 * It should be noted that while all these values are stored as strings, the SCM
 * URL string will be transformed into an URI, and so it should be parseable
 * into one.
 * <p>
 * Also, no kind of localization framework is included in this service. If, for
 * example, the title needs to be localized, then it should be so in the
 * received {@code Properties}, or the {@code getApplicationName()} should
 * return a key for the localization framework.
