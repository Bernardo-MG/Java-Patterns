/**
 * Service for acquiring an application's information. This is the kind of info
 * which would be shown on the "about" dialog.
 * <p>
 * The main use of this interface is storing that general information which may
 * be used to identify the program or the people who worked on it, but that is
 * not vital for the application's correct work.
 * <p>
 * If any of the methods is unable to return a valid value, it is expected to
 * return {@code null}, and not throw an exception or give any random value.
 * <p>
 * What is a valid value may depend between implementations and applications. It
 * is possible for the service to be localized, and would for example return the
 * title in the current language, or it may just return a key to be used by the
 * localization framework.
