/**
 * Interface for the command pattern. This is the most basic type of command,
 * which doesn't return anything when executed.
 * <p>
 * A command is a behavioral design pattern which encapsulates a piece of code,
 * which this way can be stored and transmitted, until it is required to be
 * executed.
 * <p>
 * This execution is done through the {@link #execute() execute} method.
 * <p>
 * But this is not meant to be called manually. Instead a
 * {@link CommandExecutor} will receive the command and then call its
 * {@code execute} method. This way commands are kept isolated from the rest of
 * the code.
 * <p>
 * As previously stated, this a basic command which does not return anything on
 * execution. For commands which do return values use the {@link ReturnCommand}.
