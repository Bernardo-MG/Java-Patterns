/**
 * Interface for the command pattern. This is a behavioral design pattern which
 * encapsulates a piece of code so it can be handled like any object, sending or
 * storing it until needed.
 * <p>
 * Such encapsulated code is executed calling the {@link #execute() execute}
 * method. Note that if any exception is caused by the execution it is expected
 * to be let spread out of the method, and not be caught inside.
 * <p>
 * If the code requires parameters for its execution then these should be set on
 * the command's constructor, or through setter methods on the concrete
 * implementation.
 * <p>
 * There are extensions of {@code Command} for more complex cases. More exactly
 * there is one for those cases where it is required to retrieve a value after
 * it's execution ({@link ResultCommand}), and when it is required to allow
 * undoing the command ({@link UndoableCommand}).
