/**
 * Interface for the prototype pattern.
 * <p>
 * This is a substitute for the {@code Cloneable} interface, to avoid the
 * problems and unneeded complications which usually come from it.
 * <p>
 * Every class inheriting this interface should implement it, even if it's
 * parent already does, and even if it is an abstract class.
 * <p>
 * This way the {@code createNewInstance} method always returns an instance of
 * the current class.
 * <p>
 * The easiest way to implement the interface is just using a copy constructor
 * to generate a copy of the object on the {@code createNewInstance} method.
 * <p>
 * The returned class should keep as few dependencies shared with the originator
 * as possible. For example, if the original contains a collection, the created
 * instance should have a copy of that collection, but not the same collection.
